# Homebrew

##### Setup Homebrew

Homebrew is a package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

##### Detect potential system problems

```
brew doctor
```

##### Activate cask

Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Google Chrome.

```bash
brew cask
```
